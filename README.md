# Bartending Game

### A game to learn how to mix drinks.

I created this game to put my new JavaScript skills to the test.  
I wrote it from scratch using ES6 Vanilla JavaScript.  
This was my first time dynamically populating the HTML.

The concept and design for this game came from my days as a bartender.

I kept the design simple but here are some other ideas that would add complexity and interest:
- Multiple customers showing up at random times with different drink orders
- Having a time limit to serve each drink before the customer gets too angry and leaves
- Different levels that unlock new ingredients and new drinks
- Having an image that shows the igredients added rather than listing them
- Drag and drop with pouring sound effects
- Tooltips that provide instructions when you first visit the page
